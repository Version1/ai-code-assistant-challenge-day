# Level 1: PDF to Digital Service Transformation

## What you'll do

Transform a real government PDF form into an accessible digital service using AI tools.

## Why this matters

PDF forms create barriers for citizens. They fail accessibility requirements and exclude people from services they need.

**The legal context:** The Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 (amended 2022) and Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 require government services to be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.

**The problem with PDFs:**

- Screen readers and assistive technologies cannot read them properly
- People with disabilities cannot access services independently
- Everyone faces friction: download, print, complete by hand, scan or post, then wait
- No validation means incomplete applications and delays
- Vulnerable groups who most need services are disproportionately affected

**The opportunity:** AI tools can rapidly transform these legacy processes into accessible, user-centred digital services. Services that meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards, follow proven design patterns, and deliver better outcomes for citizens.

## What you'll create

A complete digital service that replaces a PDF form. Your service must:

- Capture all the data from the original PDF
- Follow GOV.UK Design System patterns and components
- Meet WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards
- Validate user input with clear, helpful error messages
- Work without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- Work on mobile and desktop devices

Your service must also include these government service patterns:

- A start page explaining the process
- A "check your answers" page before submission
- A confirmation page with a reference number
- Email confirmation (mocked or simulated)
- A service name following GDS conventions

## Choose your PDF form

Select one real government PDF form to digitise:

### Housing and benefits

- Housing Benefit application forms (many councils still use PDFs)
- Council Tax Support forms (often combined with housing benefit)
- Examples: South Gloucestershire Housing Benefit Form, City of London Housing Benefit Application

### Licensing and permits

- Event licence applications (temporary event notices, premises licences)
- Business licence forms (street trading, alcohol licences)
- Building control applications (building regulations approval)

### Community services

- School admission forms
- Community centre booking forms
- Allotment waiting list applications

## Choose your approach

You can tackle this challenge using either or both of these approaches:

### Prompt-driven development

Use comprehensive prompting with AI tools to generate services directly.

**Best for:** Quick prototypes, straightforward forms, rapid iteration.

### Spec-driven development

Create structured specifications that generate working implementations.

**Best for:** Complex services, reproducible results, formal documentation requirements.

### Combining approaches

Start with spec-driven for architecture and planning. Switch to prompt-driven for rapid iteration. Return to spec-driven for documentation and compliance checks.

## Next steps

Choose your PDF form and your approach, then follow the relevant implementation playbook to build your service.
