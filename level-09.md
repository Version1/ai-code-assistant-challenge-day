# Level 9: Multi-Service Architecture Design

**Theme: AI-powered system integration and cross-government service orchestration**

## Challenge Overview

Government departments operate interconnected services that must work together seamlessly to deliver joined-up citizen experiences, but current architectures often create silos that force citizens to navigate multiple systems for single life events. Under the Government Transformation Strategy 2017-2020 and the updated Digital Government Vision 2025, departments must implement "life event" approaches that orchestrate multiple services around citizen needs rather than departmental boundaries.

The 2024 Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report on "Government by Algorithm" emphasised that "fragmented digital architectures prevent government from delivering the seamless, citizen-centered services that modern digital capability should enable" with citizens currently required to "repeat information, navigate multiple authentication systems, and understand complex departmental boundaries that should be invisible to service users."

**The problems with current government service architecture:**

- Monolithic departmental systems preventing cross-government service integration and data sharing
- Inconsistent authentication and identity management across government services requiring citizens to maintain multiple accounts
- No systematic approach to handling service failures and dependencies that can cascade across multiple government functions
- Limited ability to adapt service workflows when policy changes require coordination across multiple departments
- Citizens forced to understand and navigate departmental structures rather than completing coherent life event journeys
- Data synchronisation challenges creating inconsistencies when citizen information changes affect multiple government services
- No systematic resilience planning for service dependencies, creating single points of failure across government functions

**The specific challenge of cross-government service orchestration:**

Modern government service delivery requires sophisticated architectural coordination:
- **Life event orchestration:** Citizens moving house need coordinated updates across council tax, electoral registration, NHS records, DVLA, and multiple other services
- **Cross-departmental data consistency:** Changes to citizen circumstances must propagate accurately across all relevant government services without duplication or inconsistency
- **Service dependency management:** When one government service is unavailable, dependent services must gracefully degrade rather than creating complete failure cascades
- **Policy change adaptation:** New regulations or policy updates must be implemented consistently across all affected services without manual coordination overhead
- **Identity and authorization federation:** Citizens must authenticate once and access all relevant government services without repeated identity verification

**The opportunity:** AI tools can design comprehensive multi-service architectures that orchestrate government services around citizen life events, handle complex service dependencies, and ensure resilient operation when individual components fail. This approach transforms fragmented departmental systems into coherent, citizen-centered service ecosystems whilst maintaining security, compliance, and operational autonomy.

## The Challenge

**Objective:** Use AI tools to design a comprehensive multi-service architecture for a complex government life event that requires orchestration across multiple departments and services

- Design complete system architecture for "Starting University" life event requiring coordination across Student Finance, Local Authority, NHS, Electoral Registration, and Banking services

## Source Materials: "Starting University" Life Event Journey

Use this complex government life event as the foundation for your multi-service architecture design:

### Life Event Context
A UK citizen starting university requires coordination across multiple government and related services, representing typical cross-government integration challenges found in all major life events.

### Required Service Integrations

**Student Finance England/Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland:**
- Student loan application and approval processes
- Maintenance grant eligibility and payment scheduling  
- Tuition fee loan arrangement and direct payment to universities
- Academic progress monitoring and continued funding validation

**Local Authority Services:**
- Council tax exemption application and approval for student status
- Electoral registration update for new university address
- Library registration and access provision
- Local council services notification of address change

**NHS Services:**
- GP registration at university location with medical record transfer
- Prescription service continuity across different NHS trusts
- Mental health and student counseling service access
- Emergency contact and next of kin information updates

**Electoral Registration:**
- Voter registration at university address with dual registration options
- Postal vote arrangement for home constituency elections
- Local council election eligibility at university location
- Integration with university accommodation address changes

**Banking and Financial Services Integration:**
- Student account setup with identity verification through government services
- Student discount and benefit eligibility validation
- Integration with student loan payment processing
- Address change notification across financial service providers

### Complex Workflow Requirements

**Multi-Stage Approval Processes:**
- Student Finance application requiring academic offer verification, means testing, and credit checks
- Council tax exemption requiring student status confirmation and address validation
- NHS registration requiring identity verification and previous medical record location

**Conditional Dependencies:**
- **IF** Student Finance approved **AND** university enrolment confirmed **THEN** enable council tax exemption
- **IF** NHS registration requested **THEN** locate previous GP records **AND** transfer to new trust area
- **IF** electoral registration updated **THEN** notify relevant local authorities **AND** enable local voting eligibility

**Cross-Service Data Synchronisation:**
- Address changes must propagate consistently across all services with validation and conflict resolution
- Student status changes (suspension, withdrawal, graduation) must update all dependent services systematically
- Identity verification completed once must enable access across all relevant government services

**Failure and Edge Case Scenarios:**
- Student Finance system outages must not prevent university enrolment or other service access
- Address validation failures must provide alternative verification methods without blocking critical services  
- Service integration errors must be automatically detected and provide clear citizen guidance for resolution

## Supporting Resources

This challenge focuses on **architectural design and documentation** rather than code implementation. The output should be a comprehensive design artifact that can be created using Claude's artifact capabilities.
