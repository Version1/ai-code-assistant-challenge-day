# Level 5: Complex Business Logic Implementation

**Theme: AI-powered government policy automation and intelligent rules engine design**

## Challenge Overview

Government departments implement thousands of policy-driven services requiring complex business rule evaluation - from environmental compliance assessments to licensing eligibility determination. The 2023 Environmental and Sustainability Strategy mandates that organisations over certain thresholds must publish Carbon Reduction Plans demonstrating compliance with Net Zero commitments, but the assessment process currently relies on manual policy interpretation by civil servants.

Under the Procurement Policy Note 06/21 (Taking account of Carbon Reduction Plans) and the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, government departments must evaluate supplier Carbon Reduction Plans against specific criteria before contract award. However, this evaluation process is currently:

**The problems with manual policy implementation:**

- Inconsistent policy interpretation across different government departments and procurement teams
- Time-intensive manual assessment creating bottlenecks in government procurement processes
- Policy rules scattered across multiple documents, guidance notes, and regulatory updates
- No systematic validation of business logic implementation against evolving environmental policy requirements
- High cognitive load on civil servants interpreting complex interdependent policy criteria
- Risk of non-compliant assessments exposing government to legal challenge
- Inability to adapt quickly to changing environmental regulations and Net Zero policy updates

**The specific challenge of Carbon Reduction Plan assessment:**

Carbon Reduction Plan evaluation requires simultaneous consideration of:
- **Baseline measurement criteria:** Historical emissions data validation and completeness assessment
- **Reduction target evaluation:** Science-based target alignment with Net Zero trajectory requirements  
- **Action plan assessment:** Credibility and measurability of proposed reduction interventions
- **Governance verification:** Board-level commitment and accountability structure validation
- **Supply chain integration:** Assessment of indirect emissions reduction through supplier engagement
- **Monitoring and reporting:** Evaluation of measurement, verification, and progress reporting capabilities

These criteria have complex interdependencies, threshold-based evaluations, and require consistent application across thousands of annual government procurement decisions.

**The opportunity:** AI tools can systematically implement complex government policy logic through intelligent rules engines that ensure consistent policy application, enable rapid policy updates, and provide transparent decision audit trails. This approach transforms manual policy interpretation into systematic, auditable, and adaptable government decision-making processes whilst maintaining human oversight and accountability.

## The Challenge

**Objective:** Build an intelligent Carbon Reduction Plan assessment system that implements complex government policy logic through AI-designed rules engines and business logic automation

- Design and implement a comprehensive rules engine for Carbon Reduction Plan policy evaluation
- Handle complex interdependent policy criteria with threshold-based assessments and conditional logic

## Source Materials: Government Environmental Policy Documents

Use these real government policy requirements as the foundation for your rules engine design:

### Carbon Reduction Plan Assessment Criteria

**Core Policy Documents:**
- **Procurement Policy Note 06/21:** "Taking account of Carbon Reduction Plans in the procurement of major government contracts"
- **Environmental Reporting Guidelines:** HM Treasury guidance on greenhouse gas reporting requirements
- **Net Zero Strategy:** UK Government plan for decarbonising all sectors of the UK economy
- **Science Based Targets Initiative:** International framework for corporate emissions reduction target setting

### Assessment Categories and Thresholds

**Baseline Measurement (25% of total score):**
- Historical emissions data completeness (minimum 3 years Scope 1, 2, and material Scope 3)
- Data verification standards (independent third-party verification for organisations >£5m annual emissions)
- Boundary definition clarity (operational vs financial control methodology)
- Emission factor currency (use of current DEFRA or internationally recognised factors)

**Reduction Targets (30% of total score):**
- Science-based target alignment (1.5°C pathway compliance for organisations >500 employees)
- Target timeframe adequacy (interim targets every 5 years minimum)
- Scope coverage comprehensiveness (minimum inclusion of material Scope 3 categories)
- Trajectory credibility (linear vs exponential reduction pathway validation)

**Action Plan Credibility (25% of total score):**
- Intervention specificity (quantified impact estimation for major reduction initiatives)
- Investment commitment (budget allocation and financing strategy clarity)
- Timeline feasibility (delivery milestones with accountable ownership)
- Technology deployment (proven vs emerging technology risk assessment)

**Governance and Accountability (20% of total score):**
- Board-level commitment (CEO/Chair signed commitment with performance linkage)
- Organisational structure (dedicated Net Zero role for organisations >1000 employees)
- Progress reporting (quarterly internal reporting with annual public disclosure)
- Supply chain engagement (supplier emissions reduction requirement integration)

### Complex Policy Rules and Interdependencies

**Threshold-Based Evaluations:**
- Organisations >£5m turnover: Enhanced verification requirements
- Organisations >500 employees: Science-based target alignment mandatory
- Organisations >1000 employees: Dedicated Net Zero governance role required
- High-risk sectors (aviation, shipping, steel): Additional sector-specific criteria

**Conditional Logic Examples:**
- **IF** organisation reports Scope 3 emissions **AND** supply chain represents >40% of total emissions **THEN** supplier engagement programme required
- **IF** science-based targets not aligned **BUT** organisation commits to SBTi validation within 12 months **THEN** conditional compliance acceptable
- **IF** historical data incomplete **BUT** organisation demonstrates third-party verification commitment **THEN** reduced baseline scoring applied
