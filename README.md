# UK Government Head of Engineering AI Workshop

Welcome to the Head of Engineering Challenge Workshop. This event has been pulled together to provide practical AI coding existing experience through progressive challenge based learning, working in teams of 2-3, focusing on real-world government service development scenarios.

## Workshop Objectives

- **Challenge-Based Learning**: Progressive 10-level challenge system with increasing difficulty and scoring
- **Practical AI Experience**: Hands-on experience with modern AI development tools including Claude Code, Kiro/Q Developer, and others
- **Production-Ready Practices**: Focus on maintainable, scalable, and secure solutions suitable for government services
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Team-based challenges tackling real government service scenarios
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Create lasting resources for continued AI-assisted development across departments

## Government Context

All materials in this repository consider public sector requirements:
- **Security**: Government security standards and data protection requirements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design principles
- **Transparency**: Open source approaches and auditable development practices
- **Scalability**: Patterns suitable for citizen-facing services at scale
- **Compliance**: GDS standards and cross-government best practices

## Supported AI Tools

While tool-agnostic in approach, the workshop focuses on:
- **Claude Code** Anthropic's development-focused AI assistant
- **Amazon Q Developer**: AWS-integrated development assistant (formerly CodeWhisperer)
- **Kiro**: AI-powered development assistant
- **GitHub Copilot**: Traditional IDE-integrated assistance
- **Cursor**: AI-first development environment

## Additional Tools Available 
- **Example Government AI SDLC MCP Server**: 
- **Example Government Standards MCP Server**:
- **Spec-Kit**: [Github Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)

**Ready to begin?** Start with the [Setup Guides](setup-guides/) to configure your AI development tools for the workshop.

*This repository serves as both a workshop resource and a long-term reference for AI-assisted development in government contexts. We hope it provides lasting value for your teams and projects!*
